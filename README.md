<h1> Designing an Information Security Policy in accordance to NIST Cybersecurity Framework </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through how to design a simple Information Security Policy document in accordance to NIST Cybersecurity Framework 800-53. We will customise the policy to make it applicable to our organisation and industry a SME (Small Medium Enterprise company). We will ensure the policy document is aligned with business objectives, implementable by the organization, and practical for compliance. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Office word </b> 
- <b>NIST Cybersecurity Framework 800-53</b>

<h2>Information Security Policy </h2>

- <b> An Information Security Policy is a set of rules and guidelines that dictate how information technology (IT) assets and resources should be used, managed, and protected. It applies to all users in an organization or its networks as well as all digitally stored information under its authority.
- In simple terms the policy plainly communicates in writing, what the expectated and acceptable behavior for an organization information systems.
 
 <h2>Key important notes </h2>
- An information Security policy needs to be applicable to your organization to the size, to the industry, to the governance, to the way business is done there. 

-The policy needs to be readable and easy to understand.You have to assume that not everybody is going to be able to consume a policy the same way. 

-When writing a policy,you need to verify whether or not the organization has a policy template,the information security policy needs to fold into the overall    organizational approach to policy and policy adoption

-The policy needs to be enforceable by an organization.

-The policy baseline should be NIST 800-53 which is a collection of information security controls and each control aligns with a family
